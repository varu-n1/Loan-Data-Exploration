# Loan-Data-Exploration
# Installation
This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. It is highly recommended that you use the Anaconda distribution to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:
<ul>
<li>Numpy</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
<li>Seaborn</li></ul>

# Project Motivation
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project.I was interested in using Prosper Loan Data to better understand :

## Univariate Exploration:
<ul>
<li>Loan status</li>
<li>Employment Status</li>
<li>Stated Monthly Income</li></ul>

## Bivariate Exploration:
<ul>
<li>Status and Prosper Rating</li>
<li>Credit Start with Listing Category</li>
<li>Loan Status and Loan Amount</li>
<li>Prosper Rating and Employment Status</li></ul>

## Multivariate Exploration:
<ul>
<li>Rating, Loan Amount and Loan Status</li>
<li>Credit category, Credit rating and outcome of Credit</li>
<li>Amount, Listing Category Loan and Loan Status Interact</li></ul>

# Project Overview
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations
